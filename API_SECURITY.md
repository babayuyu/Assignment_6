# API Security Best Practices

## 1. Authentication

- Always use strong authentication mechanisms like JWT or OAuth 2.0
- Implement proper token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Store secrets securely using environment variables

## 2. Authorization

- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Validate permissions for every request

## 3. Input Validation

- Validate all incoming data
- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use proper data types and formats

## 4. Rate Limiting

- Implement to prevent brute force and DDoS attacks
- Consider different limits for authenticated vs unauthenticated users
- Return proper headers (X-RateLimit-\*)

## 5. HTTPS

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Enforce HTTPS with HSTS headers
- Consider certificate pinning for sensitive applications

## 6. CORS

- Configure CORS properly
- Whitelist specific origins
- Limit allowed methods and headers

## 7. Security Headers

- Implement security headers like:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - X-Content-Type-Options

## 8. Logging and Monitoring

- Log security-relevant events
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Implement alerting for anomalies

## 9. Regular Updates

- Keep all dependencies updated
- Regularly review and update security configurations
- Stay informed about new vulnerabilities

## 10. Error Handling

- Don't expose sensitive information in errors
- Use generic error messages for security-related failures
- Log detailed errors server-side only
